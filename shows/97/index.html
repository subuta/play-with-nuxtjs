Dolvett Quince and Jen Widerstrom return to train eight contestant teams of two, all with compelling stories. Seven teams (spouses, parent/adult child, siblings, relatives, best friends) will know each other, but one team will be two strangers - former "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant and the original "Survivor" winner, Richard Hatch, and 'The Voice' season two semi-finalist Erin Willett. Having both been in the NBC family previously, the two share the same goal as the other 14 contestants - to change their lives and get healthy. The renovated "Biggest Loser" gym, featuring a new interior and exterior branded with the new logo, has modernized equipment to help contestants better achieve their fitness goals, including eight high-tech monitors on the walls of each side of the gym that will track contestants' calorie burns as well as heart rates. Half of the gym will be dedicated to Team Dolvett and the other half dedicated to Team Jen. The weigh-in will be very different this season with a new look and double scales, so contestants on opposing teams can weigh-in side by side, making the weigh-in even more compelling to watch. The contestant house is also getting a whole new look for season 17.</p></div> <img src="http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/730.jpg"> <p><a href="/">Back to /</a></p></div></div></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__=function(e){return{layout:"default",data:[{show:{id:97,url:"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/97/the-biggest-loser",name:"The Biggest Loser",type:"Reality",language:"English",genres:["Drama"],status:"Ended",runtime:60,premiered:"2004-10-19",officialSite:e,schedule:{time:"21:00",days:["Monday"]},rating:{average:e},weight:0,network:{id:1,name:"NBC",country:{name:"United States",code:"US",timezone:"America/New_York"}},webChannel:e,externals:{tvrage:5618,thetvdb:75166,imdb:"tt0429318"},image:{medium:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/730.jpg",original:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/730.jpg"},summary:'<p>NBC\'s <b>The Biggest Loser</b>, a show known for its incredible weight loss makeovers, will reveal an exciting makeover of its own when the popular series returns on Monday, January 4 (9-11 p.m. ET) with new host Bob Harper, a new "Temptation" theme, an updated state-of-the-art gym, a new logo, fun format changes and a return to the popular team vs. team competition.

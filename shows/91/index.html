Wild child Rebecca Wright knows how to have a good time, but she also happens to be one of L.A.'s toughest and most respected criminal court judges.

She parties too much and rocks out on the drums in a band with her best friend, Jenny. While there's no shortage of male admirers who would love to spend time with her, she's not ready to settle down... except when an 8-year-old boy - whose parents were put in jail by Rebecca - needs her help.

Sawyer has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt, after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others. Self-centered Shannon - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone , constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. And young Claire is eight months pregnant and ill-prepared for the hardships of motherhood - especially on a deserted island.</p></div> <img src="http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/1389.jpg"> <p><a href="/play-with-nuxtjs/" class="nuxt-link-active">Back to /</a></p></div></div></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__={layout:"default",data:[{show:{id:123,url:"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/123/lost",name:"Lost",type:"Scripted",language:"English",genres:["Drama","Adventure","Supernatural"],status:"Ended",runtime:60,premiered:"2004-09-22",officialSite:"http://abc.go.com/shows/lost",schedule:{time:"21:00",days:["Tuesday"]},rating:{average:8.5},weight:88,network:{id:3,name:"ABC",country:{name:"United States",code:"US",timezone:"America/New_York"}},webChannel:null,externals:{tvrage:4284,thetvdb:73739,imdb:"tt0411008"},image:{medium:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/1389.jpg",original:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/1389.jpg"},summary:"<p>Out of the blackness, the first thing Jack senses is pain.

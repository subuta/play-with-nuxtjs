Already in shock, Nathan is even more aghast when his meddlesome mom decides to move in with him. Meanwhile, his absent-minded dad imposes upon Nathan's sister Debbie, her husband Adam and their daughter. Nathan's best friend and news cameraman Ray was excited to be Nathan's wingman in the dating scene, but Carol manages to even cramp his style.

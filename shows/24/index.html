Detective Steve McGarrett, a decorated Naval officer-turned-cop, returned to Oahu to investigate his father's murder and stayed after Hawaii's former governor persuaded him to head up the new team: his rules, no red tape and full blanket authority to hunt down the biggest "game" in town. Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny "Danno" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p></div> <img src="http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/174/435520.jpg"> <p><a href="/play-with-nuxtjs/" class="nuxt-link-active">Back to /</a></p></div></div></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__={layout:"default",data:[{show:{id:24,url:"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/24/hawaii-five-0",name:"Hawaii Five-0",type:"Scripted",language:"English",genres:["Drama","Action","Crime"],status:"Running",runtime:60,premiered:"2010-09-20",officialSite:"http://www.cbs.com/shows/hawaii_five_0/",schedule:{time:"21:00",days:["Friday"]},rating:{average:7.7},weight:99,network:{id:2,name:"CBS",country:{name:"United States",code:"US",timezone:"America/New_York"}},webChannel:null,externals:{tvrage:24840,thetvdb:164541,imdb:"tt1600194"},image:{medium:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/174/435520.jpg",original:"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/174/435520.jpg"},summary:"<p><b>Hawaii Five-0</b> is a contemporary take on the classic series about a new elite federalized task force whose mission is to wipe out the crime that washes up on the Islands' sun-drenched beaches.
